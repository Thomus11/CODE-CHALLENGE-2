this is week 2 code challenge where we were required to create an interactive shopping list
on the html there's a div containing a form which has the input having the input name & price and the add button
on the css i've styled the body,h2,button,div to have a better look on the browser
on the js is where a lot of code has been done for making the shopping list user interactive
on js i've used the querryelecyor method to target the classes in my html;getelementbyid to target the id
i've also used the event listener also innerhtml & appendchild
And the shopping list is as usser interactive as it was reqired to be
